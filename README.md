# TemplatedFunctions
These are some templated functions I use often in my projects. Because they are templated, they have to be defined in a header. I usually separate my definition and implementation between header and .c/.cpp file.

# Functions
bool IsBetween(T low, T high, T target)
void PrintVector(std::vector<T> v)
T ReturnSmaller(T lhs, T rhs)
T ReturnLarger(T lhs, T rhs)
std::vector<T> ReservedVector(int n)
